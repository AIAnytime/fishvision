# Welcome to FishVision 🐬

### FishVision identifies the different species of Fishes. It is trained on "A Large Scale Fish Data" available on Kaggle using pretrained model "MobileNetV2".

**Currently, It only classifies among 9 species:** 👇

**['Hourse Mackerel',  'Black Sea Sprat',  'Sea Bass', 'Red Mullet', 'Trout',  'Striped Red Mullet',  'Shrimp',
'Gilt-Head Bream', 'Red Sea Bream']**


## Built Using Transfer Learning, Streamlit, and Love  ❤️

You can read more on MobileNetV2 here: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/MobileNetV2

If you want to train on same data, find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset




## What Next?

**I am preparing a custom dataset with more species (No class imbalance obviously) to feed into the training and thus to improve the performance in near future**.

Thanks 😇
